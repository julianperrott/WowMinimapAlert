# WowMinimapAlert
Alerts you by playing an wav file when a node is visible on the World of Warcraft minimap.

When it is running it looks at the portion of the screen where the minimap is and if it sees and yellow (the colour of a node) then it will alert you.

Uses:

1. Alerts you as you run around the map not paying full attention.
2. Camp out a node (e.g. Black Lotus) while you read a book / watch a video etc.
